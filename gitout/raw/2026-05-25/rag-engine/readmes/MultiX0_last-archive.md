## Overview
**The Last Archive** is an integrated solution for private web archival and semantic search. It empowers users to crawl, index, and interact with web content through a unified interface, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector search technology—all while maintaining complete data sovereignty on local infrastructure.

## Key Features
*   **Privacy-First RAG**: Context-aware intelligence using your personal archives without external API dependencies.
*   **Semantic Retrieval**: Advanced vector-based search that understands intent beyond simple keywords.
*   **Modular Microservices**: Dockerized components that communicate over a unified internal network.
*   **Local-First Design**: Engineered to run entirely offline, ensuring data privacy and fast response times.
*   **Hybrid Storage**: Combines relational metadata (SQLite) with vector embeddings (Qdrant).
*   **Ethical Archival**: Built-in support for `robots.txt` compliance and controlled crawl rates.

## Architecture
The platform is engineered as a distributed system of specialized microservices to ensure modularity and performance:

*   **Spider (Go)**: A high-concurrency web crawler capable of archiving complex site structures, including HTML, images, and PDF documents.
*   **Embedding Service (Python)**: Utilizes state-of-the-art transformer models to generate high-dimensional vector representations of text.
*   **Llama-Go (Go)**: A high-performance bridge for Ollama, providing OpenAI-compatible LLM inference endpoints.
*   **Search Server (Node.js)**: The central orchestration layer that manages the API, coordinates between services, and handles persistent storage.
*   **Frontend (Next.js)**: A premium, responsive user interface built with React 19 and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Qdrant**: A robust vector database used for semantic similarity search and high-speed retrieval.

## Tech Stack
| Component | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16, React 19, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS |
| **Primary API** | Node.js (Express), Better-SQLite3 |
| **Logic/Crawling** | Go 1.25 |
| **AI Inference** | Python (PyTorch/Transformers), Ollama |
| **Vector Engine** | Qdrant |

## Quick Start
The easiest way to get started is using the provided CLI tools for your platform.

### Prerequisites
*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
*   [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (For local LLM hosting)
*   [Go 1.21+](https://golang.org/) (Required for local crawler execution)

### 1. Initialize & Start Services
Use the CLI to create the internal network and launch all microservices:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x archive.sh
./archive.sh up
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\archive.ps1 up
```

### 2. Seed the Archive
Once the services are active, use the CLI to add your first websites to the index:

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./archive.sh crawl
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\archive.ps1 crawl
```

### 3. Access the Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:
*   **Web UI**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
*   **API Health**: [http://localhost:1213/api/health](http://localhost:1213/api/health)

## Configuration
Key environment variables used across the services (managed via `.env` files in each service directory):

| Variable | Description | Default Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `LLAMA_BASE_URL` | Endpoint for the LLM bridge | `http://llm-server:1410` |
| `EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | Endpoint for the embedding service | `http://embedding-service:5050` |
| `QDRANT_HOST` | Hostname for the Qdrant database | `qdrant` |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | Authentication key for Qdrant | `REQUIRED` |
| `PORT` | Listening port for the search server | `1213` |

## Very Important Note (Read Before Complaining)

**The Last Archive is NOT magic out of the box.**

This system is **entirely database-driven**.  
If your database is empty or barely populated, **the model will appear “dumb” — because it has nothing to work with.**

### Read this carefully:

- You **must let the crawler run for a decent amount of time**.
- You **must crawl a meaningful amount of data** before expecting useful answers.
- The **more content you crawl, the better the system gets** — this is how RAG works.
- If you crawl one website (or worse, one page) and then complain that *“it’s not working”*, that is **your mistake**, not a bug.

### About Issues (Yes, This Is Blunt)

**Do NOT open an issue stupidally saying “it’s not working” when:**
- You didn’t let the crawler run long enough  
- Your database is almost empty  
- You don’t understand how the service works  
- You didn’t read the documentation  

That is **not a bug**. That is **user error**.

### Design Reality Check

- The model **does not hallucinate knowledge**.
- It **only responds based on what exists in the database**.
- No data = no intelligence.
- More crawled data = better answers.

### Stability Statement

This project has been **tested thoroughly on both Windows and Linux** before publishing.  
The services, crawler, and pipeline **work as intended** when used correctly.

If you don’t know how to use the service, **that is your own issue**, not a reason to open an issue.

---

### How to Run the System (Yes, This Matters)

You **must run the system using the provided shell or PowerShell scripts**, depending on your operating system.

**Do NOT run `docker-compose` manually from the root directory.**  
If you do that and nothing starts, **that is NOT a bug**.

### Why?

- The system is **split into multiple microservices**.
- Each service has **its own Docker configuration**.
- All services communicate over a **specific internal Docker network**.
- That network is **created and managed by the provided shell (`archive.sh`) or PowerShell (`archive.ps1`) scripts**.

If you skip the scripts:
- The network will not be created correctly
- Services will not discover each other
- The system will not start properly

Again: **this is expected behavior, not a bug**.

### Final Warning (Seriously)

- Do **NOT** run services separately unless you **actually know what you’re doing**.
- Do **NOT** mix manual Docker commands with the automated setup.
- Do **NOT** open a stupid issue about this when you:
  - Didn’t follow the instructions
  - Don’t understand Docker
  - Ignored the setup scripts

There is a **shell script and a PowerShell script for a reason**.  
Use them.
