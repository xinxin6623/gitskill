## Installation

### Prebuilt from website (Recommended)

[Installation Guide](https://dotstate.serkan.dev/#installation)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://dotstate.serkan.dev/install.sh | bash
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install dotstate
```

### Using Homebrew

```bash
brew tap serkanyersen/dotstate
brew install dotstate
```

Or use the direct install:

```bash
brew install serkanyersen/dotstate/dotstate
```

## Quick Start

1. **Launch DotState**:

   ```bash
   dotstate
   ```

2. **First-time Setup**:
   - Choose how to set up your repository:
     - **Option A: Create for me (GitHub)** - DotState creates a repo on GitHub
       - Enter your GitHub token (create one at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
       - **Tip**: You can also set the `DOTSTATE_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
       - Choose repository name and visibility (private/public)
     - **Option B: Use my own repository** - Bring your own git repo
       - Create a repo on any git host (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
       - Clone it locally and set up your credentials
       - Point DotState to your local repo path

3. **Add Your Files**:
   - Navigate to "Manage Files"
   - Select files to sync (they're automatically added)
   - Files are moved to the repo and symlinked automatically

4. **Sync with Remote**:
   - Go to "Sync with Remote"
   - Your files are committed, pulled, and pushed automatically

That's it! Your dotfiles are now synced and ready to use on any machine.

## CLI Usage

DotState also provides a powerful CLI for automation:

```bash
# List all synced files
dotstate list

# Add a file to sync
dotstate add ~/.myconfig

# Sync with remote (commit, pull, push)
dotstate sync

# Sync with custom commit message
dotstate sync -m "My custom commit message"

# Activate symlinks (useful after cloning on a new machine)
dotstate activate

# Deactivate symlinks (restore original files)
dotstate deactivate

# Show the current profile
dotstate profile

# List all profiles
dotstate profile list

# Switch to another profile
dotstate profile switch work

# Package management
dotstate packages list                    # List packages with status
dotstate packages add -n ripgrep -m brew -b rg  # Add a package
dotstate packages check                   # Check what's installed
dotstate packages install                 # Install missing packages

# Check for updates and upgrade
dotstate upgrade

# Show help
dotstate help
```

## Shell Completions

Generate completions for your shell:

```bash
# Bash
source <(dotstate completions bash)

# Fish
dotstate completions fish | source

# Zsh
source <(dotstate completions zsh)
```

Using oh-my-zsh, antigen, or prezto? These frameworks require the fpath approach:

```
  mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
  dotstate completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_dotstate
```

Then add `fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)` to your .zshrc before your framework loads.

## How It Works

1. **Storage**: Your dotfiles are stored in a Git repository (default: `~/.config/dotstate/storage`)
2. **Symlinks**: Original files are replaced with symlinks pointing to the repo
3. **Profiles**: Different profiles can have different sets of files
4. **Inheritance**: Profiles can inherit from a parent — child files override parent files, common files have the lowest priority
5. **Common Files**: Files that are shared across all profiles are stored in the `common` section and linked regardless of the active profile
6. **Sync**: Changes are committed and synced with GitHub automatically

## Working with Profiles

Profiles are how DotState organizes your dotfiles for different machines or contexts. Each profile has its own set of files, while **Common Files** are shared across all profiles automatically.

```
               ┌────────────────────┐
               │ Common Files       │
               ├────────────────────┤
               │ .tmux.conf         │
               │ .gitconfig         │       ┌────────────────────┐
               │ .vimrc             │       │ Server             │
               │                    │       ├────────────────────┤
               │                    ├──────►│ .bashrc            │
               │                    │       │ .profile           │
               └─┬─────────────────┬┘       │ .config.toml       │
                 │                 │        └────────────────────┘
                 │                 │
                 ▼                 ▼

├────────────────────┤           ├────────────────────┤
│ .zshrc             │           │ .zshrc             │
│ .sshconfig         │  Copy     │ .sshconfig         │
│ ...                ├──────────►│ ...                │
│                    │           │ workfile.sh        │
└────────────────────┘           └────────────────────┘
```

### Creating Profiles

In the TUI, go to **Manage Profiles** and press `C` to create a new profile. You can:

- **Start blank** for a completely new setup
- **Inherit from an existing profile** to create a live link — the child automatically gets all parent files and packages, and you only override what's different
- **Copy from an existing profile** to carry over files and packages as a one-time snapshot — great for setting up a similar machine quickly

**Inherit vs Copy:** Inheritance is a live relationship — changes to the parent are reflected in the child. Copy is a one-time fork — after creation, the two profiles are independent.

### Profile Inheritance

A profile can inherit from one parent. When activated, DotState resolves files from the full chain:

1. **Child's own files** (highest priority)
2. **Parent's files** (inherited unless overridden)
3. **Grandparent's files**, etc.
4. **Common files** (lowest priority)

```
          base
           │  .zshrc, .vimrc, .tmux.conf
           │
         work (inherits base)
           │  .zshrc (overrides base's)
           │  .ssh/config (own)
           │
       work-laptop (inherits work)
              .ssh/config (overrides work's)
```

In this example, `work-laptop` gets: its own `.ssh/config`, work's `.zshrc`, and base's `.vimrc` and `.tmux.conf`.

Cycles are detected and rejected. Profiles that are inherited by others cannot be deleted until the inheritance is removed.

### Switching Profiles

Select a profile and press `Enter` to switch. DotState will remove symlinks for the old profile and create symlinks for the new one automatically (including inherited files). Common files stay linked regardless of which profile is active. If activation fails, the old profile is automatically restored.

### Common Files

You decide which files are shared. Move any file to **Common** and it will be symlinked in every profile. Common files stay linked when you switch profiles. To move a file between profile-specific and common:

1. Go to **Manage Files**
2. Select a file
3. Press `M` to move it to Common (or back to the active profile)

### Use Cases

- **Multi-machine**: Use a `Personal` profile on your laptop, `Work` on your work machine, and `Server` for headless setups. Keep shared configs (`.gitconfig`, `.tmux.conf`) in Common.
- **Same computer, different contexts**: Create profiles like `day`, `night`, or `focus` with different terminal themes and defaults, and switch between them instantly.
- **Layered configs with inheritance**: Create a `base` profile with your core setup, then have `work` and `personal` inherit from it — each only overrides what's different (like `.zshrc` or `.ssh/config`). Changes to `base` automatically flow to all children.
- **Quick duplication**: When setting up a second machine, create a new profile by copying from an existing one, then tweak what's different.

## Configuration

### Repository Setup Modes

DotState supports two repository setup modes:

#### GitHub Mode (Automatic)

Let DotState create and manage a GitHub repository for you. Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token.

**GitHub Token Options:**

DotState supports both **Classic tokens** and **Fine-grained tokens** (recommended).

<details>
<summary><strong>Option 1: Fine-grained Token (Recommended)</strong></summary>

Fine-grained tokens offer better security through granular permissions. Create one at [github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new).

**Required permissions:**

| Permission         | Access Level | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Administration** | Read & write | Create your `dotstate-storage` repository |
| **Contents**       | Read & write | Sync your dotfiles to/from the repository |

> **Note:** Metadata (read-only) is automatically included by GitHub for all fine-grained tokens.

**Repository access:**

- For initial setup, select **"All repositories"** so DotState can create and find your storage repo
- After setup, you can regenerate a token restricted to only your `dotstate-storage` repository

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Option 2: Classic Token</strong></summary>

Create a classic token at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

**Required scope:** `repo` (Full control of private repositories)

</details>

**Token Configuration:**

1. **Environment Variable** (Recommended for automation):

   ```bash
   export DOTSTATE_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
   # or for fine-grained tokens:
   export DOTSTATE_GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_your_token_here
   ```

   The environment variable takes precedence over the config file token.

2. **Config File**: The token can be stored in the config file (set during first-time setup).

#### Local Mode (Bring Your Own Repo)

Use any existing git repository from any host (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted, etc.).

**Setup:**

1. Create a repository on your preferred git host
2. Clone it locally: `git clone <url> ~/.config/dotstate/storage`
3. Ensure you can push: `git push origin main`
4. In DotState, choose "Use my own repository" and enter the path

**Benefits of Local Mode:**

- Works with any git host
- Uses your existing SSH keys or git credentials
- No GitHub token required

### Update Notifications

DotState automatically checks for updates and shows a notification in the main menu when a new version is available. You can also check manually:

```bash
# Check for updates interactively
dotstate upgrade

# Just check without prompting
dotstate upgrade --check
```

**Configuration:**
Update checks can be configured in `~/.config/dotstate/config.toml`:

```toml
[updates]
check_enabled = true       # Set to false to disable update checks
check_interval_hours = 24  # How often to check (default: 24 hours)
```

### Theme Configuration

DotState supports both light and dark themes that automatically adapt to your terminal background. The theme affects all UI elements including colors, borders, text, and syntax highlighting in file previews.

**Changing the Theme:**

Edit `~/.config/dotstate/config.toml` and set the `theme` option:

```toml
theme = "dark"              # Default dark theme
theme = "light"             # For light terminal backgrounds
theme = "midnight"          # Deep dark blue theme
theme = "solarized-dark"    # Solarized Dark
theme = "solarized-light"   # Solarized Light
theme = "gruvbox-dark"      # Gruvbox Dark (warm, retro)
theme = "gruvbox-light"     # Gruvbox Light
theme = "catppuccin-mocha"  # Catppuccin Mocha (pastel dark)
theme = "catppuccin-latte"  # Catppuccin Latte (pastel light)
theme = "tokyonight-dark"   # Tokyo Night (city-lights dark)
theme = "tokyonight-light"  # Tokyo Night Light
theme = "nocolor"           # Disable all UI colors (same as NO_COLOR=1 / --no-colors)
```

**Theme Features:**

- **Automatic Syntax Highlighting**: File preview syntax highlighting automatically matches your selected theme
- **Consistent Colors**: All UI elements (headers, footers, borders, lists, text) use theme-appropriate colors
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Works with both light and dark terminal themes
- **No Colors Mode**: Use `--no-colors` CLI flag or `NO_COLOR=1` to disable all colors:
  ```bash
  dotstate --no-colors
  ```
  Or:
  ```bash
  NO_COLOR=1 dotstate
  ```

**What Changes with Theme:**

- Text colors (dark text on light backgrounds, light text on dark backgrounds)
- Border colors (adjusted for visibility)
- Highlight colors (selection indicators, focused elements)
- Syntax highlighting themes in file previews
- Status colors (success, warning, error indicators)

### Keymap Configuration

DotState supports customizable keyboard shortcuts with preset keymaps (Standard, Vim, Emacs) and custom key binding overrides. The keymap system allows you to use your preferred keyboard layout and override any action with any key combination.

**Available Presets:**

- **Standard**: Arrow keys (↑↓), Enter, Esc, standard navigation
- **Vim**: Vim-style navigation (hjkl for movement, q to quit, etc.)
- **Emacs**: Emacs-style navigation (Ctrl+N/P for up/down, Ctrl+G to quit, etc.)

**Changing the Preset:**

Edit `~/.config/dotstate/config.toml` and set the `preset` option in the `[keymap]` section:

```toml
[keymap]
preset = "vim"  # Options: "standard", "vim", "emacs"
```

**Custom Key Binding Overrides:**

You can override any key binding with custom keys. Overrides take precedence over preset bindings and shadow preset bindings for the same action.

Example configuration:

```toml
[keymap]
preset = "vim"

# Override 'x' to quit instead of 'q'
[[keymap.overrides]]
key = "x"
action = "quit"

# Override 'w' to move up instead of 'k'
[[keymap.overrides]]
key = "w"
action = "move_up"

# Use Ctrl+H for help
[[keymap.overrides]]
key = "ctrl+h"
action = "help"
```

**Available Actions (all in snake_case):**

- **Navigation**: `move_up`, `move_down`, `move_left`, `move_right`, `page_up`, `page_down`, `go_to_top`, `go_to_end`, `home`, `end`
- **Selection**: `confirm`, `cancel`, `toggle_select`, `select_all`, `deselect_all`
- **Global**: `quit`, `help`
- **Actions**: `delete`, `edit`, `create`, `search`, `refresh`, `sync`, `check_status`, `install`
- **Text editing**: `backspace`, `delete_char`
- **Navigation**: `next_tab`, `prev_tab`
- **Scroll**: `scroll_up`, `scroll_down`
- **Prompts**: `yes`, `no`
- **Forms**: `save`, `toggle_backup`

**Key Format Examples:**

- Single keys: `"j"`, `"k"`, `"q"`, `"x"`
- Special keys: `"up"`, `"down"`, `"enter"`, `"esc"`, `"tab"`, `"space"`
- Function keys: `"f1"`, `"f2"`, etc.
- Modifier combinations: `"ctrl+n"`, `"ctrl+shift+j"`, `"ctrl+h"`

**How Overrides Work:**

- Overrides take precedence over preset bindings
- When you override an action (e.g., `move_up`), all preset bindings for that action are shadowed/removed
- If you override `move_up` with `"w"`, the original preset key (e.g., `"k"` in vim preset) will no longer work for that action
- Display functions (footer hints) automatically reflect your actual key bindings, including overrides

**Example:**

See `examples/keymap_override_example.toml` for a complete example configuration file.

## Security Considerations

- **No Shell Injection**: All commands use direct execution, not shell interpretation
- **Path Validation**: Dangerous paths (like home directory root) are blocked
- **Git Repository Detection**: Prevents nested Git repositories
- **Backup System**: Automatic backups before any file operation
- **Token Security**: GitHub tokens can be provided via `DOTSTATE_GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable (recommended) or stored in config files with secure permissions

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Latest stable version (for building from source)
- **Git**: For repository operations
- **Git Account**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or any git host (optional, for cloud sync)
- **(Recommended) Nerd Fonts**: For the best visual experience, we recommend using a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) to see all icons correctly.
